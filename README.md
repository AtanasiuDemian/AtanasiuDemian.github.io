# Atanasiu Stefan Demian - Data Analysis Portfolio
(under progress)

This repository is a collection of notebooks I wrote with the purpose of analyzing data and implementing machine learning algorithms. Some of the datasets used in the notebooks are from the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, Springer, 2013 (abbreviated as ISLR henceforth). More information about the book can be found [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

# Regression

## Shrinkage and PCR: College dataset [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AtanasiuDemian/Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning---Python/blob/master/College.ipynb)
I analyze the College dataset from ISLR, which contains information about 777 universities and colleges in the US. The objective is to predict the number of applications received by a college using 4 regression models: Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso and Principal Components Analysis (PCR).
